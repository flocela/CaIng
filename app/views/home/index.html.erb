    This phone application may make practicing English more interesting. It shows you the lyrics and their direct translation into Spanish. It also shows what the real meaning of the words are in the context of the song. I chose the songs because I though they had beauty and spoke to real life in America.  Some are rough, some are happy.  This Android app is for free on the <%= link_to 'Google Play Store', 'https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eebolf.CantandoIngles' %>. You can download the songs to use in the app for free. Check out the <%= link_to 'video', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-cRzeZw9Bk' %>. For phones with Android 4.0 and above.
